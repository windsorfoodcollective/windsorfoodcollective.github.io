<div class="row column">
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>Each household pre-orders a box of groceries every week.  A bulk order is made and delivered the following week.  The bulk order is packed by a team of volunteers on Wednesday afternoon 
ready for the rest of us to pick up in the early evening. To keep prices acceptable and because we value the community aspect, everyone is a volunteer.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="medium-6 columns">
<h3>Ordering</h3>
<p>Order online weekly from 9pm Tuesday to 9am Thursday.</p>
</div>
<div class="medium-6 columns">
<h3>Packing</h3>
<p>Every three weeks your team packs the bulk order into individual household orders.  We meet at Northey St around 4pm and it takes about an hour to pack.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="medium-6 columns">
<h3>Collecting</h3>
<p>Collect your order from Northey St Community Farm on Wednesday evening after 6pm.  You will receive a text message when your order is ready to be collected.</p>
</div>
<div class="medium-6 columns">
<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>Pay your invoice weekly via bank deposit.  There is a small weekly surcharge (a few dollars) which covers the costs of delivery, software and rent.</p>
