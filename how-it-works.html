<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>We’re a bunch of folks into eating ethical foods. In line with the permaculture ethics of Earth Care, People Care and Fair Share, we want to make ethical and healthy food affordable and accessible to members of the community, while contributing to an alternative food system which doesn’t involve supermarkets, large food miles, fertilisers, pesticides and their associated environmental problems.</p>

<p>Each household pre-orders a box of goodies every week.  A bulk order is made and delivered the following week.  The bulk order is packed by a team of volunteers on Wednesday afternoon 
ready for the rest of us to pick up in the early evening. To keep prices acceptable and because we value the community aspect, everyone is a volunteer.</p>

<h3>Packing</h3>
<p>Every three weeks your team packs the bulk order into individual household orders.  We meet at Northey St around 4pm and it takes about an hour to pack.</p>
