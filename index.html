<p>We are a buying group operating out of Northey St Community Farm.<p>

<p>The goal of the collective is to provide healthy and ethical foods to the community at a reasonable price. We abide by the permaculture ethics of earth care, people care and fair share.  Our actions contribute to an alternative food system that doesnâ€™t involve supermarkets, large food miles, chemical fertilisers, pesticides and their associated environmental problems.</p>
